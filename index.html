            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>
                I am from a small town in West Texas named Pecos, Tx.  Moving to Austin has been such a huge change in my life for the better I love everything about it and am excited
                to see where this city will take me! I am currently working as an Office Manager at a physical therapy office.  I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Kinesiology, 
                and have just decided that is not the route I would like to go.  I want to move on 
                to the future, and the future to me is in Technology! I am highly motivated to make this work and very eager to apply my learnings outside of the classroom!
